# üéµ Spotify ‚Üí Tidal Basic GUI

A simple desktop interface for transferring your Spotify playlists into Tidal.
This project is a **fork of the incredible [spotify\_to\_tidal](https://github.com/spotify2tidal/spotify_to_tidal) tool**, created by **axel-de-block** and contributors, with a **basic GUI wrapper** added.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** I did not create the original sync engine. Full credit and respect goes to the original authors of `spotify_to_tidal`. This fork simply adds a **basic GUI wrapper** to make the tool easier to use.
